# Clone and Use üìã

- The website is completely built on `react-js` library of `javascript` and that's why we need `nodejs` and `npm` installed
- While installing `nodejs` and `npm`, try to install versions which are equal or greater than the versions mentioned in badges above
- In case you want to help developing it or simply saving it, you can fork the repository just by clicking the button on the top-right corner of this page
- After the successful installation of `nodejs` and `npm`, clone the repository into your local system using below command:
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Porgramming-Hero-web-course/b7a9-career-hub-Alamin0x01.git
  ```
  This will clone the whole repository in your system.
- To download required dependencies to your system, navigate to the directory where the cloned repository resides and execute following command:
  ```node
  npm install
  ```
- Now the project is ready to use
- You can check it using `npm start`, it will open the website locally on your browser.

# Vite.js is a development tool that comes with a dev server and is used for modern web applications. It offers a faster and smoother workflow in terms of development. It has two major parts:

A dev server serves the source files over native ES modules, with build-in features and fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for updating modules during the execution of the application. When changes are made to the source code of an application, only those changes are updated, without the need to reload the entire application. This helps speed up the development time.

A build command enables us to bundle our code with Rollup and offers highly optimized static assets for production.

# Get started with Vite.js

To start with Vite, we can use create-app bootstrapper. The tool supports popular front-end libraries, including React and Vue. To use Vite, we need Node.js and npm installed on our computers.

The following command will run a Vite-bootstrapped application:

```node
 npm init @vitejs/app //using npm
```

```node
 yarn create @vitejs/app //using yarn
```

The prompts on the terminal will guide us in building the application. Once the application is created, we need to run npm install, then npm run dev to start the development server. Vite also supports vite build that builds the application for production and vite preview for previewing our build locally

# Configuration

We can have complete control over the project by extending the default configuration with vite.config.js or vite.config.ts file files in the working directory. A basic config file looks like this:

```node
// vite.config.js
export default {
  // config options
};
```
